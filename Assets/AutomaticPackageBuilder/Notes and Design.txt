Automatic package builder:

The automatic package builder creates a new package every time it sees a push from the unity-sdk repo then uploads it.
From there the applications using the sdk will periodically check for updates; then download and install them.

As the project grows and the number of games using the mega fans sdk so too will our manual build time.



Planned features:

Packager
    - used to package the sdk into a .unitypackage file.

Uploader
    - used to upload the .unitypackage file to dropbox or other location depended on whats needed.

Build server
    - triggered from github web hooks,  this will auto test, package, upload, and ping testing staff on slack.
    - Build server requires:
        Server - AWS, Firebase, Azure or something like that.  Could be run on a employees always on system.
        Jenkins - used to automate everything and gives us a nice web ui to check for logs and completion.
        Commandline Unity setup.
        GitHub web hooks.

Optional Test runner
    - Used to check for errors, functionality, and stop regression issues that come as projects grow.
    - This would be awesome but its a luxury.
    - Optional.

Auto patcher
    - Client side patching and downloader.
    - This checks our server to see if there is a new version and auto-magically downloads it and sets it up.
