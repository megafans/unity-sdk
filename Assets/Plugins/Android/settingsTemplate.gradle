// This file contents should be placed at Assets/Plugins/Android/settingsTemplate.gradle
// This works around Unity's 2019.3 bug where their root build.gradle is placing buildscript under allprojects
// On it's own it doesn't create issues however doing so means including a buildscript block in any sub projects
//   such as "unityLibrary" which is generated from the template Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle does not work.
// It results in a build error of "Configuration with name 'compileClasspath' not found." on a lint task.
// Normally adding "lintOptions { abortOnError false }" bypasses any lint task errors however
//   either due to a bug with the Android Gradle plugin or an order of operations this does seem to be applying in this case.
// Until Unity fixes their root build.gradle we will need to keep using this file to enable any additional Gradle plugins.
